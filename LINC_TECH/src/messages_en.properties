delorean2 = Screenwriters/producers/directors Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis actually received a letter from John DeLorean after the film's release, thanking them for using his car in production. In fact, 3 DeLoreans were used during filming. The DeLorean was deliberately chosen for its appearance and "seagull wing" style doors, making it plausible that people in 1955 assumed it was an alien ship.

juiz2 = When Marty is on trial at the auditions of the new bands at the beginning of the film, the judge who stands up to say that they "play too loudly" is Huey Lewis, whose songs, "The Power of Love" and "Back in Time" are part of the film's soundtrack.

atores2 = After four weeks of filming, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale felt that Eric Stoltz was not the right actor for the role of Marty McFly and Stoltz agreed. Being Michael J. Fox the replacement for the role, he had to reshoot all the scenes made by Stoltz that generated about three million dollars more in the budget.

His kick and the jump on the speakers are from Pete Thousand (The Who), playing the guitar while lying down comes from Angus Young (AC/DC), the floor crouching while kicking the air is by Chuck Berry, his solo with the guitar next to his face is by Edward Van Halen (Van Halen) and the style of playing with the guitar on his back is Jimi Hendrix.

billy2 = Billy Zane (Cal Hockley in Titanic) makes his first film appearance in this film as "Match", one of Biff's compars. Ironically, despite having the most solid career of the four class members after "Back to the Future", he was the only one in the class who had absolutely no lines while on the scene.

einsten2 = Christopher Lloyd based his performance as Doc Brown on a combination of physicist Albert Einstein, conductor Leopold Stokowski and the character Rotwang, the inventor of the film Metropolis (1927) played by actor Rudolf Klein-Rogge. 
conteudo.cafe =The café owner in 1955 mocks the idea of a black mayor, but the first black mayor of a California city had been elected decades earlier. It was Edward Duplex, elected mayor of Wheatland in 1888.

conteudo.senhorAneis2 = Just as the previous film released in the cinema the actor Billy Zane, this here was also the premiere of another actor who would become famous. Elijah Wood. He plays one of two boys who talk to Marty about the '80s video game at the 2015 diner, right at the beginning of the film. Years later, the actor would be the protagonist of one of the greatest works of cinema; the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. The other boy is John Thornton, who did not pursue an artistic career after small roles in TV series, leaving the profession in 1992.

conteudo.george2 = Crispin Glover (George McFly in "Back to the Future" (1985)) during the negotiations of the second film ended up demanding absurd things and by not entering into a consensus with the label was withdrawn from the sequels. Jeffrey Weissman was cast as George and, using crispin's face molds made on the set of the first film, created facial prostheses to make Jeffrey similar to Crispin, so that they could recreate excerpts from the original film to incorporate them into this sequel. All the scenes in which George McFly appears in this film (except the appearance in the reprise of the final scene of the previous film) he is being played by Weissman.

hoverboard2 = Twenty-six years after the film's release, The Lexus Corp., with the aid of superconductors (cooled by liquid nitrogen) and magnets (on the board and buried in the ground beneath it), built a functional hoverboard. Another company, Hendo, has also built a prototype that does not require refrigeration and works with engines that create a magnetic field that "literally pushes itself, generating the force that makes the board latveron on the ground", but that at the current stage, requires that the surface on which it works is composed of non-ferromagnetic conductors. Although they work, these prototypes are still far from being practical enough to be used on a day-to-day life.

elizabeth2 = Elisabeth Shue was cast as Jennifer for this sequel, and all scenes from the closing of "Back to the Future" (1985) were re-filmed for the beginning of this film. Claudia Wells (jennifer in "Back to the Future") was unable to reprise her role as she needed to take a break from her career to care for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.
